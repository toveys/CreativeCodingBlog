# Fractal Tree No Background

I watched some canvas coding videos from a youtuber called Frank's Laboratory and they had a video about H-Fractals. They made a random fractal generator where the user could use sliders to manipulate the parameters of the fractal. The video essentially used the same techniques as the Coding Train recursion video but also explained how the canvas changes when using the transformation functions.
