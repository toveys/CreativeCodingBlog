# Prototype 1

This is my first blog post!

For my first assignment I thought it would be quite cool to have a matrix inspired animation.
I am a big fan of the matrix so of course when I think "coding" I think of old computers and 
CLIs. As a kid before I knew how to code I'd hop on my dad's box of a computer and mouse over the desktop.
When the computer booted up there would often be a Command Prompt window that popped up and would scroll rapidly through some sort of 
initialization process. This was always fascinating to me and I knew for sure that thats how hacking would look like.

The matrix title sequence is also quite iconic so I decided to combine those two experiences for my first prototype.

I used the green text on a black background along with randomly generated numbers in binary.

This prototype was pretty simple and lacked the scrolling text like the Matrix had. I iterated along the x axis, and while doing so I iterated along the Y
axis and printed a 1, 0, or no value at all randomly. I also had a random value generated for the colunm length so that the columns would look uneven. I wanted the RMIT text in the middle like the Matrix title, but I had trouble picking a color that wouldn't hurt to look at, and would also stand out from the chaos happening in the background. I chose red because of the RMIT color branding, but wasn't quite what I wanted. I knew that I would have to use arrays to create columns of values that could move down the screen instead of just printing in place, but I wasn't too sure on how to manipulate things inside an array, especially when there would be countless things, so I watched some Coding Train videos on them.
